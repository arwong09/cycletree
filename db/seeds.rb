I made this site as my final project at App Academy.  In just 8 intensive weeks, we learned, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, Backbone.js, JQuery, HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap.  And at the end of it all, this was the project I put together with all those new skills!  I\'ve always been a fan of Craigslist - classifieds are a great way for people to trade between each other.  That\'s why I made this site, it captures the classifieds functionality of Craigslist, with the added benefit of user profiles and reviews, so you know who you\'re dealing with.

After working in wet labs, I really liked the logical breakdown of programming. Things actually do exactly what I tell them to!
